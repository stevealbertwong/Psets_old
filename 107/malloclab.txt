/* 15-231 malloc recitation */

1. Marcos:

DEFIN:
Marcos - mechanism in c before program gets compiled could do find and replace
e.g. 
#DEFINE NUM_ENTRIES 100 // define constant 
#DEFINE twice(x) (2*(x)) // define simple operation or function, wrap in () since naive search and replace


USAGE:
- faster than function calls -> since NO call queue, calling conventions with function calls: moving stuff into register, jump, stack pointer, when we are done undo all of that jump back to where we were before. 
- search and replace -> allows us to updates all occurence at once.
- e.g. macros ideal way for quick access to header information (payload size, valid, keep track of blocks of memory freed)


2.Inline function:

DEFIN:
Inline an existing function -> at compile time replaces function calls with code-> so no need to do stack conventions as it is not making a call
add inline at the beginning of the function

USAGE:
- getting full benefit of type checked arguments
- useful for functions that are called frequently 
 


3. Pointer review:
i.e. casting, dereferencing, arithmetic

CASTING:
Casting from pointer type a to pointer type b

Casting from pointer type a to int/unsigned int 

- all pointers are 8 types long interger in 64 bits system
- just changing the intepretation what kind of pointer it is
 
??? writing pointer into location as number you are manipulating 
contructing pointer directly by doing arithmetic on them

POINTER ARITHMETIC
- pointer + 1 -> address of the pointer + 1*size of the pointer type 
e.g. 
int* pointer = something;
(void*) pointer2 = (void*) (pointer+2);
this is really computing -> pointer2 = pointer + (2*sizeof(int));
in assembly -> lea (i.e. load effective address) lea (pointer, a, sizeof(int)), pointer2;
